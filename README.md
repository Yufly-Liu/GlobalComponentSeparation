e propose to employ high-frequency binary masks to modulate phase-shifting and Gray code patterns and eliminate the interreflection among object surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively separate direct and indirect illumination and suppress interreflection to enhance the accuracy of 3D object measurement.
